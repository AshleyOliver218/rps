# <ins>Rps- Rock Paper Scissors</ins> 
&nbsp;
This project was a simple game I created with a design that I wanted to be simple and self explanatory. I wanted for a child to be able to figure out
what is going on during the game and inherently understand how to play it. The game is a very classic and simple game so I wanted mimic
those sentiments in my design. I added small surprise elements that created pops of color and movement to enhance the simple design aesthetics.

# <ins>Motivation</ins>
&nbsp;
I created this game for a class project at Per Scholas. I knew this game would help me not only put together all of the puzzle pieces of what we had learned so far into a bigger picture, but it would also help me learn a lot along the way.

# <ins>Possible Changes?</ins>
&nbsp;
If I could change anything about my game I would add a sleek mode that completely restyles the page and gives it a more sleek design.

I would also like to add mobile compatibility.

I watched several videos for research (listed above) and each video gave me an idea of something to add to my game!

I also want to thank Jenna, Yonas, Amari, and Kasper for help on the small details of my code's functionality. Your help was greatly appreciated!
